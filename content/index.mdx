<Text as='h2' fontSize='3xl'>Hello, and welcome! ðŸ‘‹</Text>

<Text>Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate researcher at the University of Torontoâ€™s <Link color='teal.500' href='https://crl.utm.utoronto.ca/'>Continuum Robotics Lab (CRL)</Link>, where Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working under the guidance of <Link color='teal.500' href='https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jbk/'>Dr. Jessica Burgner-Kahrs</Link>. My current research focuses on numerical optimization and static modeling of Continuum Robots. I am also involved in developing software for the <Link color='teal.500' href='https://www.opencontinuumrobotics.com/'>Open Continuum Robotics Initiative</Link> - a project that aims to make Continuum Robotics more accessible for all by providing open source software and hardware along with educational articles and tutorials.</Text>

Outside of work, you might find me enjoying a Salsa social or at the local public library trying to learn a new language (espaÃ±ol no es facil y me hace sentir tonto ðŸ™ƒ). I also love biking, traveling, and reading but, to be honest, who doesnâ€™t ðŸ˜…

*I am lucky to have wonderful people in my life who continue to support me throughout this journey. If you think that I could be helpful in anyway, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!*
