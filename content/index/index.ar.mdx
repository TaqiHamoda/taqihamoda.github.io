<Text as='h2' fontSize='3xl'>السلام عليكم! 👋</Text>

<Text>I’m currently an undergraduate researcher at the University of Toronto’s <Link color='teal.500' href='https://crl.utm.utoronto.ca/'>Continuum Robotics Lab (CRL)</Link>, where I’ve had the privilege of working under the guidance of <Link color='teal.500' href='https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jbk/'>Dr. Jessica Burgner-Kahrs</Link>. My current research focuses on numerical optimization and static modeling of Continuum Robots. I am also involved in developing software for the <Link color='teal.500' href='https://www.opencontinuumrobotics.com/'>Open Continuum Robotics Initiative</Link> - a project that aims to make Continuum Robotics more accessible for all by providing open source software and hardware along with educational articles and tutorials.</Text>

<Text>I’ve been fortunate to receive recognition for my academic endeavors, including the <Link color='teal.500' href='https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/dean/awards-grants/undergraduate-awards-grants/utm-undergraduate-research-grants'>University of Toronto Mississauga’s Undergraduate Research Grant</Link> and the prestigious <Link color='teal.500' href='https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp'>NSERC’s Undergraduate Student Research Award</Link>.</Text>

<Text as='h3' fontSize='2xl'>Hobbies</Text>

Outside of work, you might find me enjoying a Salsa social or at the local public library trying to learn a new language (español no es facil y me hace sentir tonto 🙃). I also love biking, traveling, and reading but, to be honest, who doesn’t 😅

*I am lucky to have wonderful people in my life who continue to support me throughout this journey. If you think that I could be helpful in anyway, please don’t hesitate to reach out!*
